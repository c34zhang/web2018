        <h2>Week 8 Reading Response</h2>
        <P>
        1. With our increasing desire to make objects smaller and reduce the size of their form, visual art may survive, but what about other forms of physical art? If this trend is to continue and extend to art and design, how will this affect our relationship with physical and spatial forms of art?

        <br><br>
        2. A single photograph can now be replaced with thousands of pictures we keep in a device â€” as art grows more obtainable, how will artists adapt to the increasing demands for new content?
