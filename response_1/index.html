        <P>
        1. What are some methods artists can use to make their web pages more engaging and interactive - especially since work tends to be presented in 2D? How can artists incorporate sound, video, movement, dialogue, and search to make their content feel engaging, yet not overloaded? What other techniques can be used that are often overlooked?
        <br><br>
        2. Coding one's own website is often appealing because it offers direct control and personalization, but usually requires heavy, continual maintenance. What are the challenges, and costs, involved in building a portfolio website (and/or any other types of web pages)?
