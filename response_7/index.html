        <h2>Week 7 Reading Response</h2>
        <P>
        1. Cao and Giuditta cite “computers interpreting human language, mechanical servos interpreting code” as source of human conflict with machine. How, or in what ways, do these two systems conflict with each other? Is there ever a perfect marriage or merge of the two, or will they always be disjointed?

        <br><br>
        2. Cao and Giuditta also question Lehni’s design process: “do the mechanics and constraints of code inform your process in a fluid way?” How do the constrains of code impact creativity for artists? Does it inhibit by suppressing an idea, or does it encourage an alternative form of thought that actually aids creativity?
        </P>
