        <P>
        1. The author mentions that the technical nature of using MetaFont for type designers contributed to the steady decline of MetaFont creations. Why have designers been resistant to this application? Does this structured, mathematical analysis and formation of fonts limit the liberty of artists to freely and organically create?
        <br><br>
        2. The author mentions that the initial interpretation of the word design meant simply to apply a better aesthetic (as he quotes, just a “relook” means to give a new and better “look” or shape to something). When, and what what in history was the point in which design actually began to possess meaning?
