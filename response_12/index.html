        <h2>Week 12 Reading Response</h2>
        <P>
        1. Bourriaud likens contemporary art as an existence; a period of time to be encountered. What will be the future of contemporary art, if it is to continue down this generative path? How will our interactions with art forms, technology, and both change (if at all)?
        <br><br>
        2. If art is a social symbol and a rhetoric of change, then what should define, or be the limit of art? If art is symbolic, is it limited to physical form? Or can items intangible, and more representational be considered art?
        </P>
