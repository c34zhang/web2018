        <h2>Week 11 Reading Response</h2>
        <P>
        1. The web may be what we make it, but as a large portion exists that is not connected (as Tim Berners Lee previously mentioned), is it a closed or one-sided narrative? Can the web actually ever truly provide diverse forms of thought?
        <br><br>
        2. “This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.” Although this may be ideal, can this ever be achieved? Especially as these platforms gain increasing numbers of users, and thus more ownership of web and personal content?
