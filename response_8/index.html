        <h2>Week 8 Reading Response</h2>
        <P>
        1. With the plethora of open source resources, and the frequency of artists merging both their own and others code, can a mechanical design ever be described as original? Or rather, belonging to a single individual?

        <br><br>
        2. How will the increasing mechanization of design impact our perception of design and its value? Will other, more traditional art forms (non-mechanical) decrease or increase in popularity? Or in value?
        </P>
