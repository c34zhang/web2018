        <P>
        1. How does styling impact the way the message is portrayed and perceived? Especially of the same content? Do certain styles correlate with any particular content? Or do certain styles speak to a particular audience?
        <br><br>
        2. At what point does style become a hindrance and impede the message relayed? What cases exist in which overstyling has become its pitfall?
        </P>
